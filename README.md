# workflowy-native-app

WorkFlowy is an awesome task manager/organizer todo-list do-everything do-anything web app. However, the only desktop offering they have is a Chrome app. Unfortunately, when using keyboard shortcuts (command + tab) to switch between applications, the WorkFlowy Chrome app and Chrome itself show and hide together and the behavior clunky.

This project will help you create a native desktop WorkFlowy app. It uses [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) and [`electron-packager`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) to build and run a native for your OS (macOS, Windows and Linux supported). Internally, it renders the WorkFlowy web app (there is no offline support). This app will correctly render external links in your browser, unlike another [similar solution](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflowy-menuapp/id965079797?mt=12).

> NOTE: it appears WorkFlowy is [working on a native app for real](https://workflowy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203295295-Offline-Apps), so this is a stopgap solution (without offline support).

## Prerequisites

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) version 4.0 or greater.

## Usage

Download or clone this repo and `cd` into the directory:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:kweiberth/workflowy-native-app.git
$ cd workflowy-native-app
```

Install the project dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

Build the native app

```
$ npm run build
```

`electron-packager` will build the app specifically for your OS, and the output of the build process will be located in this current directory. In the case of macOS, you will see a folder called `WorkFlowy-darwin-x64`. Inside of this folder will be the `.app` application file called `WorkFlowy.app`. Copy this into your `Applications` folder, open it and you should be good to go! Once it's working, feel free to delete this project from your computer. The `.app` file all you need.

If you are on Windows or Linux, the built application will likely be similar but different. Hopefully you can figure it out ðŸ˜¬.
